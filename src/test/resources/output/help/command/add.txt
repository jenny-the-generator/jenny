Usage: jen add ALIAS URL

Add a new repository of templates to Jenny.

Arguments:
  ALIAS  A name to use to refer to the repository in the future.
  URL  The full URL of the repository.

Jenny creates projects for you from templates. Templates are stored in repositories
and must be downloaded to your machine before you can use them.

When you add a repository to Jenny, you must provide an alias which is then used in the
future to refer to templates in that repository. It's just a bit shorter than having to
use the URL every time! You can use any alias you want as long as you haven't already
used it.
